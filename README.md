###I have written a new package utilizing TVMaze's API. Hope to post it soon.

# TVRage
<p>Java library for accessing the <a href="http://services.tvrage.com/info.php?page=main">TVRage public API</a>.</p>
<p>Provides basic access to simple functions: searching for a show, getting show information and getting episode information.</p>

## Dependencies
API (version used)
<p><a href="https://jersey.java.net/">Jersey (v2.13)</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/">Joda Time (v2.7)</a></p>

<p>I created this API as part of a larger personal project and wanted to share it. I hope it helps someone!</p>

## Troubleshooting
<p>Unfortunately, the TVRage API tends to have intermittent latency issues resulting in slow data retrieval or possibly
even timeouts. All we can do at this point is hope that TVRage is able to address this on their end, as their free to use API
is a great resource!</p>
